# Assets

Store images, diagrams, signage templates, and other media assets used across the CIVIK Hackathons documentation site.

Guidelines:

- Organize assets into subfolders (e.g., `signage/`, `layouts/`, `photos/`).
- Include a short README or metadata file when adding new assets to describe authorship, licensing, and context.
- Optimize files for web performance (SVG or compressed PNG/JPEG) while maintaining accessibility.
- Reference assets in Markdown using relative paths (`/assets/...`).
