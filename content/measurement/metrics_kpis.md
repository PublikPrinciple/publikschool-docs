## Data collection practices

- Use mixed methods: surveys, interviews, observational notes, and system analytics.
- Align metrics with sponsor requirements and community priorities.
- Store data securely following the [Data Use Statement](../consent_attribution/data_use_statement).
- Share dashboards with stakeholders and update after major milestones (Day 2, Day 30, Day 90).

Regularly review metrics during retrospectives and integrate insights into future hackathon planning.
