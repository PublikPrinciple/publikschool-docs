## Pre-event survey (optional)

- Demographics and access needs (language, childcare, accessibility).
- Expectations for the hackathon and desired learning outcomes.
- Existing familiarity with CivikStack and challenge area.

## Daily pulse check

```
Scale: 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree)
- I felt welcomed and included today.
- I had access to the resources and support I needed.
- I understand what success looks like for my team tomorrow.
Open-ended: What helped you thrive today? What could be better?
```

- How confident are you in continuing this work post-event? (Likert scale)
- What support do you need next? (multi-select)

### Section 3: Impact & Feedback

## Crew retrospective survey

## Data management
