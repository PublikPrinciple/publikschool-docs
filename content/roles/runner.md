Runners are rapid-response problem solvers. They handle logistics errands, deliver supplies, and ensure teams have what they need without leaving their workspaces.

## Responsibilities

- Deliver equipment, signage, and materials across venue zones.
- Escort participants to breakout rooms, wellness spaces, or accessibility services.
- Relay urgent requests between teams and the Ops Lead.
- Support registration, hospitality, and teardown as needed.

## Daily workflow

1. Check in with the Ops Lead each morning for priority tasks.
2. Monitor communication channels (radio, messaging apps) for real-time requests.
3. Maintain supply caches in high-traffic zones, restocking as inventory depletes.
4. Assist with end-of-day resets by collecting materials and resetting spaces.

## Skills and traits

- Strong situational awareness and willingness to jump into any task.
- Ability to lift and transport supplies safely.
- Friendly, patient demeanor when interacting with participants.
- Familiarity with the venue layout, accessibility routes, and safety procedures.

## Tools

- Communication device (radio or secure messaging app).
- Venue maps and signage plan.
- Inventory checklist tied to the [Daily Reset](../checklists/daily_reset) guide.

Runners keep operations moving smoothly. Rotate shifts to prevent fatigue and celebrate their contributions throughout the event.
