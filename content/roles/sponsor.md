description: Responsibilities and engagement model for CIVIK Hackathon sponsors.
---

Sponsors resource CIVIK Hackathons through funding, relationships, and storytelling support. Their involvement shapes challenges, unlocks datasets, and sustains outcomes beyond the event.

## Core responsibilities

- **Strategic alignment** — Co-design challenge statements with Publik School and community partners.
- **Resourcing** — Provide financial contributions, in-kind support, or access to tools and infrastructure.
- **Governance** — Participate in decision-making councils that steward ethical considerations and equity commitments.
- **Accountability** — Commit to transparent reporting on how sponsored funds are used and impacts realized.

## Engagement timeline

| Phase | Sponsor Actions |
| --- | --- |
| Planning (T-60 to T-7) | Approve challenge briefs, finalize budget, nominate subject-matter experts, and coordinate communications. |
| Event Delivery | Deliver welcome remarks, join office hours, mentor teams, and uphold community agreements. |
| Post-Event | Review outcomes, confirm follow-up investments, and co-author impact narratives. |

## Communication protocols

- Assign a primary sponsor representative who joins weekly planning standups.
- Use shared channels (Slack/Matrix) to coordinate decisions with the Ops Lead and Lead Facilitator.
- Document approvals and commitments in the sponsor brief template located in [Templates](../templates/sponsor_brief_template).

## Skills and qualities

- Deep understanding of the civic issue area and stakeholder landscape.
- Ability to mobilize resources quickly and equitably.
- Commitment to open-source and community-centered practices.

## Success indicators

- Sponsor messaging reinforces CIVIK principles and equity commitments.
- Post-event investments or partnerships are confirmed within 30 days.
- Communities impacted by the challenge feel heard and supported.

Sponsors are critical stewards of the CIVIK Hackathon ethos. Encourage them to show up as collaborators, not just funders.
