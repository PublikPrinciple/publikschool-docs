Floor Facilitators provide direct support to participant teams. They coach, unblock, and ensure every team stays connected to the shared agenda.

## Core duties

- Guide teams through agenda milestones, checking in at the start and end of each session block.
- Surface risks, needs, and decisions to the Lead Facilitator in real time.
- Promote inclusive participation by inviting quieter voices and balancing airtime.
- Capture key updates in coordination with the assigned scribe.

## Daily rhythm

1. **Morning standup** — Align on daily goals, known risks, and support assignments.
2. **Session coverage** — Rotate between teams, offering coaching and connecting them to mentors or data resources.
3. **Integration clinics** — Partner with the Data Steward and Safety Officer to review compliance, ethics, and risk factors.
4. **Evening debrief** — Share observations, celebrate wins, and flag follow-up actions for the next day.

## Toolkit

- Facilitator schedule, including contact info for mentors and subject matter experts.
- Access to Kanban boards or documentation hubs where teams log progress.
- Checklists for accessibility accommodations and wellness check-ins.
- Rapid escalation channel (SMS/Signal) to coordinate with the Lead Facilitator.

## Skills and mindset

- Experience facilitating multidisciplinary teams.
- Comfort navigating ambiguity and switching contexts quickly.
- Training in trauma-informed or community-centered practices.
- Commitment to Publik School’s equity and accessibility standards.
