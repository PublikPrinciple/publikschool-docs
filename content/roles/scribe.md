Scribes ensure CIVIK Hackathons leave a rich knowledge trail. Their documentation powers post-event reports, Implementation Labs, and community transparency.

## Responsibilities

- Capture key decisions, blockers, and breakthroughs in shared documentation spaces.
- Maintain agendas, Kanban boards, and retrospectives in collaboration with facilitators.
- Tag materials with metadata (team name, phase, stakeholders) for easy retrieval.
- Support consent workflows by logging attribution details and linking signed forms.

## Preparation

- Review the [Attribution Capture SOP](../consent_attribution/attribution_capture_sop) and required data privacy notices.
- Set up shared folders with templates for notes, decision logs, and retrospective prompts.
- Coordinate with the Ops Lead on audiovisual recording or transcription services.

## During the event

- Shadow assigned teams, capturing quotes, metrics, and artifacts in real time.
- Sync with Floor Facilitators during breaks to validate outstanding tasks.
- Highlight risks or data needs to the Data Steward immediately.
- Collect and organize media releases, linking them to participant profiles.

## Post-event tasks

- Deliver clean notes within 48 hours, including summaries for each agenda phase.
- Support the Measurement team by tagging relevant data sources and survey results.
- Archive final KAOs with proper licensing statements in CivikStack repositories.

## Tools

- Shared document platform (Notion, Google Docs, or Coda) with version control.
- Audio recorders or transcription tools for high-stakes sessions.
- Template library stored in [Templates](../templates/incident_response) for incident reports or special circumstances.

Scribes should be detail-oriented storytellers who can keep up with fast-moving conversations while maintaining empathy and discretion.
