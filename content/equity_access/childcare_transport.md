Childcare and transportation supports remove barriers to participation. Incorporate them into planning from the outset.

## Childcare services

- Partner with licensed childcare providers familiar with culturally responsive care.
- Offer flexible scheduling that mirrors hackathon hours, including early drop-off and late pick-up.
- Provide healthy snacks, inclusive activities, and quiet areas for rest.
- Collect emergency contacts, allergy information, and consent forms in advance.
- Offer stipends or reimbursements for participants who prefer their own providers.

## Transportation support

- Provide transit passes, ride-share vouchers, or shuttle services covering key neighborhoods.
- Coordinate accessible transportation (wheelchair-accessible vans, volunteer drivers).
- Publish detailed arrival instructions with maps, parking info, and bike storage options.
- Set up a transportation hotline for last-minute support or changes.

## Budgeting & communication

- Allocate dedicated funds for childcare and transportation in the event budget.
- Communicate availability early and include sign-up forms in registration flows.
- Provide multilingual information and reminders leading up to the event.

## Staffing & accountability

- Assign a coordinator to manage childcare and transportation logistics.
- Track utilization rates and gather participant feedback.
- Maintain backup plans for provider cancellations or inclement weather.

Removing logistical barriers reinforces Publik Schoolâ€™s commitment to equity and ensures participants can focus on building impactful KAOs.
