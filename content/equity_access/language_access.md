title: Language Access
description: Policies for multilingual participation in CIVIK Hackathons.
---

Language access ensures all participants can engage fully regardless of preferred language.

## Planning

- Conduct a language needs assessment during registration and community outreach.
- Budget for professional interpreters, translation services, and captioning.
- Translate key documents: agendas, consent forms, signage, and evaluation surveys.
- Recruit bilingual facilitators or volunteers to support breakout discussions.

## Interpretation services

- Provide simultaneous interpretation for plenary sessions with headsets or streaming.
- Offer consecutive interpretation during workshops and mentor sessions upon request.
- Coordinate interpreter schedules with adequate breaks and backup coverage.
- Share glossaries of key terms (see [Glossary](../overview/glossary)) to maintain consistency.

## Translation workflows

- Maintain a centralized repository for source documents and translated versions.
- Use collaborative tools that support version control and reviewer comments.
- Time releases so translated materials are available simultaneously with originals.

## Communication norms

- Encourage facilitators to speak at a moderate pace and pause for interpretation.
- Use visual aids, iconography, and plain language to support comprehension.
- Provide text-based channels (chat, SMS) where participants can ask questions in their language.

## Feedback and improvement

- Collect feedback from multilingual participants after each event.
- Track interpreter utilization and adjust staffing for future cohorts.
- Share lessons learned with the Equity & Access team to refine policies.

Prioritize language access from the start to build trust and demonstrate Publik Schoolâ€™s commitment to inclusive civic innovation.
