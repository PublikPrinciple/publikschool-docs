title: Stipend Policy
description: Financial support guidelines for CIVIK Hackathon participants.
---

Stipends expand access by compensating participants for time, travel, or lost wages.

## Policy goals

- Reduce financial barriers for low-income, disabled, or caregiver participants.
- Recognize community expertise as valuable labor.
- Ensure transparency and fairness in distribution.

## Eligibility

- Prioritize applicants who self-identify as needing financial support.
- Offer additional consideration for participants traveling from under-resourced areas.
- Provide options for caregivers, youth, and undocumented participants who may have limited access to traditional funding.

## Stipend types

- **Participation stipends** — Flat rate per participant covering attendance.
- **Travel stipends** — Reimburse transportation, lodging, and per diem costs.
- **Childcare stipends** — Offset costs for dependent care during event hours.
- **Accessibility stipends** — Cover assistive technologies or accommodations not provided onsite.

## Distribution process

1. Collect stipend requests during registration with privacy-protected forms.
2. Communicate approval timelines and payment methods (ACH, prepaid cards, cash).
3. Disburse funds before or during the event whenever possible.
4. Provide receipts or confirmation letters for participants who need documentation.

## Accountability

- Track disbursements in a secure finance system with anonymized identifiers.
- Evaluate stipend impact through post-event surveys and interviews.
- Adjust stipend amounts annually based on cost-of-living data and participant feedback.

## Funding considerations

- Incorporate stipends into sponsor packages and budget proposals.
- Seek grants or community funds dedicated to equity and inclusion.
- Maintain a reserve to cover unexpected needs or emergency support.

Stipends are an investment in community leadership. Communicate their availability widely and reduce friction in the application process.
