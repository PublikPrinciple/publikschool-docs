---

Food is a core part of the hackathon experience. Ensure meals reflect cultural diversity and dietary needs.

## Planning

- Collect dietary preferences and allergies during registration (vegan, halal, kosher, gluten-free, nut-free, etc.).
- Partner with local vendors who can accommodate diverse cuisines and cultural practices.
- Budget for snacks and meals every 3â€“4 hours, including late-night options.

## Service guidelines

- Label every item with ingredients, allergens, and dietary indicators.
- Provide separate serving utensils to prevent cross-contamination.
- Offer individually packaged meals for participants who prefer low-contact options.
- Ensure water, tea, and coffee stations are replenished regularly.

## Cultural considerations

- Feature foods from communities represented among participants and partners.
- Schedule meals to respect fasting periods or religious observances.
- Provide non-alcoholic beverage options and clearly label any alcoholic offerings.

## Accessibility

- Ensure buffet tables are accessible to wheelchair users; provide seated service upon request.
- Offer adaptive utensils or straws as needed.
- Provide refrigeration for medications, breast milk, or personal food items.

## Waste reduction

- Use reusable or compostable dishware when possible.
- Coordinate with local mutual aid groups to redistribute surplus food safely.
- Track consumption to improve future ordering and reduce waste.
