title: Attribution Capture SOP
description: Standard operating procedure for documenting contributions to KAOs.
---

This SOP helps teams credit contributors accurately and honor the intellectual labor of CIVIK Hackathon participants.

## Objectives

- Maintain transparent records of individual and collective contributions.
- Ensure Knowledge Artifacts for Organizing (KAOs) include proper licensing and authorship.
- Support equitable recognition in post-event storytelling and funding opportunities.

## Workflow

1. **Pre-event setup**
   - Scribes prepare contribution logs linked to team workspaces.
   - Participants review licensing options (e.g., CC BY 4.0) and select preferences.
   - Confirm consent to be named publicly or anonymously.
2. **During the hackathon**
   - Capture contributions at each phase: ideation, research, design, development, storytelling.
   - Note supporting roles (mentors, sponsors, community advisors) and their inputs.
   - Flag co-created assets that require shared licensing or Memorandums of Understanding.
3. **Post-event review**
   - Validate contribution logs with team members before publication.
   - Attach logs to final KAOs and Implementation Lab documentation.
   - Share attribution summaries with sponsors and partners for transparency.

## Data fields to capture

- Contributor name and pronouns (or anonymized identifier).
- Role(s) performed and phase of contribution.
- Links to artifacts (documents, repos, media) and licensing details.
- Consent status for public recognition and media usage.

## Tools

- Shared spreadsheets or databases with version control.
- Integration with CivikStack repositories for metadata tagging.
- Template forms stored in [Templates](../templates/incident_response) for quick updates.

## Quality assurance

- Conduct random audits to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Provide participants with a channel to request updates or corrections.
- Archive attribution records alongside consent forms for future reference.

Accurate attribution builds trust, supports future collaboration, and honors the collective labor behind every CIVIK Hackathon artifact.
