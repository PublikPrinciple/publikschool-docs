## Guidance for organizers

- Provide the form digitally and in print; ensure accessible language and translations.
- Store signed releases securely and link them to media assets for attribution tracking.
- Use badge stickers or wristbands to indicate participants who have opted out.
- Coordinate with photographers and videographers to respect preferences in real time.

Combine this template with the broader [Consent Policy](./consent_policy) and [Attribution Capture SOP](./attribution_capture_sop) to maintain transparency and trust.
