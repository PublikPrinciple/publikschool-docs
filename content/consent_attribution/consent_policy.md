This consent policy ensures participants understand how their data, stories, and outputs will be used. Review it with all stakeholders and adapt to local legal requirements.

## Principles

- **Transparency** — Clearly communicate how information will be collected, stored, and shared.
- **Choice** — Offer opt-in/opt-out options for media, data collection, and research activities.
- **Care** — Protect sensitive information, particularly for vulnerable or marginalized communities.
- **Accountability** — Maintain records of consent and honor withdrawal requests promptly.

## Consent scope

1. **Participation** — Agreement to the code of conduct, safety policies, and community agreements.
2. **Data Collection** — Permission for surveys, interviews, or usage analytics; specify storage duration and access controls.
3. **Media Capture** — Consent for photography, video, audio recordings, and livestreams.
4. **Attribution** — Approval for public credit, authorship listings, and inclusion in KAOs.

## Process

- Provide digital forms during registration and paper copies onsite.
- Translate consent materials into languages represented at the event.
- Offer plain-language summaries and opportunities for questions.
- Document consent in a secure system with timestamps and contact details.

## Withdrawal and updates

- Participants can change their consent preferences at any time.
- Provide a clear contact email or hotline for updates.
- Implement a tracking log to ensure requests are honored across documentation, media, and data systems.

## Record retention

- Store consent records for a minimum of three years or in accordance with funding requirements.
- Restrict access to designated staff (Safety Officer, Data Steward, Ops Lead).
- Use encrypted storage and regular audits to prevent unauthorized access.
