title: KAO Contributor Rights
description: Guidance on rights and revenue sharing for Knowledge Artifacts for Organizing.
---

This document clarifies contributor rights when KAOs are produced, sold, or licensed after a CIVIK Hackathon.

## Principles

- **Equity** — Revenue and recognition should reflect the labor and lived experience invested by contributors.
- **Transparency** — Clearly communicate ownership structures and licensing choices.
- **Community benefit** — Prioritize reinvestment in communities impacted by the challenge.

## Licensing framework

- Default to open licenses (e.g., CC BY 4.0, MIT) unless legal or community considerations require otherwise.
- Document contributor preferences during attribution capture and align with the [Consent Policy](./consent_policy).
- If proprietary licensing is necessary, secure explicit consent from all contributors.

## Revenue sharing guidelines

1. **Initial allocation**
   - Cover direct expenses (stipends, materials) before distributing profits.
   - Set aside a community reinvestment fund (minimum 20%) for future civic initiatives.
2. **Contributor pool**
   - Distribute remaining revenue proportionally based on contribution logs and steward agreements.
   - Include mentors or community advisors when their contributions are substantial.
3. **Ongoing royalties**
   - Establish royalty structures for long-term products or services derived from the KAO.
   - Review agreements annually to account for new contributors or pivots.

## Decision-making

- Form a governance group including contributors, sponsors, and Publik School representatives.
- Use consensus or consent-based decision processes to resolve disputes.
- Document all agreements in writing and share them with stakeholders.

## Dispute resolution

- Provide a clear escalation path, starting with mediation facilitated by Publik School.
- If unresolved, engage neutral third-party mediators experienced in community IP.
- Maintain transparent records of discussions, decisions, and outcomes.

## Withdrawal

- Contributors may request removal of their work when feasible without harming the collective artifact.
- If removal is not possible, negotiate alternative recognition or compensation.

Protecting contributor rights reinforces trust and encourages continued collaboration. Review these guidelines during Implementation Lab onboarding and update them as the CivikStack ecosystem evolves.
