Reliable power and connectivity are essential for hybrid collaboration and data-intensive work.

## Power distribution

- Provide dedicated circuits for AV, livestream, and workstation areas to prevent overloads.
- Ensure outlets every 6 feet in team zones; supplement with surge-protected power strips.
- Label circuits and breakers, keeping a map at the Ops command center.
- Stage charging stations with USB-C, USB-A, and wireless options.

## Backup systems

- Rent or procure UPS units for critical equipment (routers, servers, AV racks).
- Identify backup generator availability or battery systems for extended outages.
- Prepare manual workflows (offline forms, printed agendas) in case of power disruption.

## Networking

- Minimum bandwidth: 200 Mbps symmetrical for up to 150 participants; scale accordingly.
- Provide separate SSIDs for staff, participants, and guests with documented passwords.
- Configure VLANs or QoS to prioritize livestream and hybrid conferencing traffic.
- Establish wired connections for streaming and mission-critical workstations.

## Security

- Require WPA2/WPA3 encryption and rotate passwords daily.
- Coordinate with the Data Steward to monitor network usage and detect anomalies.
- Provide VPN access for teams working with sensitive data.

## Support & monitoring

- Schedule onsite IT support during all event hours.
- Maintain a network status dashboard with alerts for outages or latency spikes.
- Log incidents and resolutions to inform future events.

Document power and networking plans in your production binder and review them with venue staff, vendors, and the Data Steward.
