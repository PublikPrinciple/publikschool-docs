Design venue zones to reinforce the CIVIK Hackathon phases and participant needs.

## Recommended zones

1. **Context Zone**
   - Large displays for data visualizations, community stories, and briefings.
   - Quiet listening areas with headsets for multilingual audio.
2. **Intention Zone**
   - Round tables or soft seating to encourage dialogue and planning.
   - Supplies: intention cards, outcomes canvases, sticky notes, markers.
3. **Vision Zone**
   - Makerspace tables with power, prototyping supplies, and whiteboards.
   - Hybrid collaboration equipment for remote contributors.
4. **Integration Zone**
   - War-room style layout with wall space for roadmaps and risk charts.
   - Access to printers, laptops, and consultation areas for mentors.
5. **Knowledge Zone**
   - Recording booth or storytelling lounge for interviews and documentation.
   - Comfortable seating, lighting, and audio equipment for podcasts or video recaps.
6. **Wellness Zone**
   - Calming environment with mats, beanbags, and sensory tools.
   - Staffed by wellness volunteers and stocked with hydration and snacks.

## Flow considerations

- Create clear pathways between zones with high-contrast signage.
- Position accessibility services (interpreters, captioning screens) near main stages.
- Ensure quiet rooms are away from high-noise areas but easy to find.
- Provide storage cubbies or lockers adjacent to collaboration zones.

## Hybrid participation

- Equip each zone with cameras and microphones for remote facilitation.
- Offer dedicated virtual breakout rooms mapped to physical spaces.
- Assign a hybrid coordinator to manage chat moderation and tech support.

Customize layouts based on venue dimensions, accessibility needs, and participant feedback. Prototype on paper or in 3D planning tools before load-in.
