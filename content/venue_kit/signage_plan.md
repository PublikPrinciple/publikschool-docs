Thoughtful signage helps participants navigate the space, access resources, and feel welcome.

## Signage types

1. **Wayfinding** — Entrance, registration, restrooms, elevators, quiet rooms, wellness spaces.
2. **Zone markers** — Context, Intention, Vision, Integration, Knowledge, Wellness.
3. **Information** — Daily schedule, Wi-Fi details, safety contacts, accessibility services.
4. **Community agreements** — Visual reminders of norms, equity commitments, and consent icons.
5. **Sponsor recognition** — Highlight partners while aligning with Publik School design standards.

## Design guidelines

- Use high-contrast colors and large fonts (minimum 72 pt for headers).
- Include Braille or tactile overlays for key signs when possible.
- Provide translations for primary languages represented at the event.
- Feature CIVIK Hackathon branding alongside venue requirements.

## Production tips

- Print core signage on durable foam board or fabric banners for reuse.
- Create modular inserts for daily schedules or room assignments.
- Laminate smaller signs for quick updates with dry erase markers.
- Store digital templates in the `assets/signage` folder with editable formats (Figma, Canva, SVG).

## Installation

- Conduct a signage walk with the Ops Lead and Accessibility Lead before doors open.
- Use removable adhesive or hooks that comply with venue rules.
- Position signs at eye level and ensure pathways remain clear.
- Assign runners to monitor signage throughout the event and adjust as needed.

## Templates

- Directional arrow sign (portrait & landscape)
- Zone banner with iconography
- Daily agenda board with time blocks
- Consent icon legend (photo OK, audio only, do not record)
- Sponsor appreciation panel

Store final signage files and print specs in the production archive so future teams can iterate quickly.
