Design hackathons to be accessible from the outset. These guidelines complement the [Equity & Access](../equity_access/language_access) policies.

## Physical access

- Provide step-free entryways, ramps, and elevators for all primary routes.
- Install automatic door openers or assign staff to assist at entry points.
- Reserve accessible seating near power outlets and clear sightlines.
- Ensure restrooms are gender-inclusive and ADA compliant with grab bars and turning radius.

## Sensory and cognitive access

- Offer quiet rooms with dimmable lighting, noise-cancelling headphones, and sensory tools.
- Provide printed materials in large format and high contrast.
- Use captioning and sign language interpretation for all plenary sessions.
- Offer visual schedules and clear iconography across signage.

## Communication access

- Translate key documents and signage into languages represented by participants.
- Provide live interpretation or simultaneous translation services.
- Ensure microphones and assistive listening systems are available and tested.
- Offer text-based communication channels (chat, SMS) for announcements.

## Dietary and wellness access

- Label all food items with ingredients, allergens, and dietary markers.
- Provide refrigeration for medications and nursing parent needs.
- Offer prayer mats, ablution spaces, or connections to nearby facilities.

## Staffing & accountability

- Assign an Accessibility Lead to coordinate accommodations and respond to requests.
- Maintain a tracking log of accommodations fulfilled and outstanding.
- Conduct daily check-ins with participants who requested accommodations.
- Collect feedback post-event to improve future accessibility efforts.

Accessibility is a continuous commitment. Budget for accommodations early and center disabled participants in planning decisions.
