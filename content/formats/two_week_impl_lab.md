description: Extended support structure for post-hackathon development and deployment.
---

The Implementation Lab extends hackathon momentum into a structured two-week sprint focused on piloting Knowledge Artifacts for Organizing (KAOs) with real communities.

## Goals

- Validate prototypes with users and impacted stakeholders.
- Establish implementation partnerships, governance, and maintenance plans.
- Capture data for impact reporting and future funding cycles.

## Cadence overview

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Day 1 | Lab Kickoff | Reconnect teams, review success metrics, and confirm schedules. | Lead Facilitator, Sponsors |
| Days 2–4 | Discovery & Testing | Field research, user interviews, data validation, and risk assessments. | Data Steward, Scribes |
| Days 5–7 | Build & Iterate | Incorporate feedback, update KAOs, and run technical experiments. | Participants, Mentors |
| Days 8–10 | Integration Planning | Define deployment steps, support requirements, and handoffs. | Ops Lead, Floor Facilitators |

## Support structures

- **Mentorship pods** — Pair teams with subject matter experts and Implementation Lab alumni.
- **Daily standups** — 30-minute check-ins to unblock issues and surface resource needs.
- **Knowledge capture** — Dedicated scribes collect decisions, metrics, and testimonials for reporting.
- **Wellness support** — Provide stipends, co-working access, and wellness sessions to sustain participation.

## Measuring progress

Track leading indicators against the [Metrics & KPIs](../measurement/metrics_kpis) dashboard:

- Number of user validation sessions completed.
- Quality of partnership commitments (letters of intent, MOUs).
- Risk mitigation status across legal, privacy, and operational categories.
- Readiness of transition plans, including maintenance owners and funding outlook.

## Transitioning out of the lab

- Archive all documentation in CivikStack repositories with appropriate licensing.
- Schedule a 30/60/90-day follow-up with sponsors and community partners.
- Submit a final report using [Reporting Templates](../measurement/reporting_templates) within five business days.
- Host a public debrief or blog post to share stories and invite broader community participation.

The Implementation Lab is a strategic investment. Plan resourcing during the hackathon so teams know what support is available and how to access it.
