title: One-Day Sprint Format
description: Schedule and design guidelines for a rapid CIVIK Hackathon sprint.
---

The one-day sprint is ideal for communities that want to mobilize quickly around a focused civic challenge. Use this format when you need momentum, alignment, and tangible next steps without the complexity of a full weekend event.

## Objectives

- Align participants on a shared problem statement and local context.
- Produce lightweight Knowledge Artifacts for Organizing (KAOs) such as playbooks, canvases, or user journeys.
- Identify champions, partners, and follow-up actions to continue development.

## Sample schedule

## Logistics checklist

- Reserve a venue with flexible seating, breakout rooms, and quiet zones for accessibility.
- Provide communal meals, hydration stations, and wellness resources.
- Ensure translation, childcare, and transportation supports are confirmed. See [Equity & Access](../equity_access/language_access).
- Prepare documentation kits: shared drives, Kanban boards, and KAO templates.

## Success indicators

- Teams leave with documented KAOs and committed stewards.
- Participant feedback highlights psychological safety, clarity of roles, and perceived impact.
- Follow-up meetings or Implementation Lab enrollment occurs within one week.

Adapt this structure for hybrid or virtual events by using virtual whiteboards, breakout rooms, and asynchronous documentation workflows.
