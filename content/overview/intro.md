title: Introduction to CIVIK Hackathons
description: Overview of Publik School CIVIK Hackathons, their purpose, and how to use this handbook.
---

CIVIK Hackathons are rapid, community-centered gatherings that mobilize public interest technologists, civic leaders, and partner organizations to co-create solutions for urgent public challenges. Hosted by Publik School within the broader CivikStack ecosystem, each hackathon is an opportunity to prototype Knowledge Artifacts for Organizing (KAOs), deepen community capacity, and demonstrate the power of open collaboration.

This handbook is designed for:

- **Organizers** who need a repeatable playbook to scope, staff, and operate hackathons.
- **Facilitators** responsible for guiding the experience and maintaining psychological safety.
- **Contributors** preparing to participate, volunteer, or sponsor an event.

## How the documentation is organized

The CIVIK Hackathons documentation is grouped by the lifecycle of an event:

1. **Principles and vocabulary** — Start with the [guiding principles](./principles) and [glossary](./glossary) to align on shared language.
2. **Formats and agendas** — Explore proven [event formats](../formats/one_day_sprint) and detailed [run-of-show agendas](../agendas/48h_run_of_show) to match your timeline.
3. **Roles and responsibilities** — Clarify expectations for every member of the hackathon crew in the [roles directory](../roles/lead_facilitator).
4. **Operational toolkits** — Use [checklists](../checklists/t_minus_30_days), [venue kits](../venue_kit/room_spec), and [equity frameworks](../equity_access/language_access) to ensure readiness.
5. **Policies and templates** — Reference standard [consent policies](../consent_attribution/consent_policy), [measurement practices](../measurement/metrics_kpis), and [communication templates](../templates/sponsor_brief_template).

Each page includes links to related materials, recommended tools, and contextual callouts highlighting lessons learned from prior CIVIK Hackathons.
