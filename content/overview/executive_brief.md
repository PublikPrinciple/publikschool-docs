# CIVIKS Hackathon — Launch Pitch Brief

**KnowledgeSport for real-world problem solving.**

## The Idea in One Sentence

Turn a big community problem into a high-performance event: seven focused teams run the same six-step loop in short rounds, swap insights at the right moments, and finish the day with a live pilot, a clear playbook, and a shared knowledge base that compounds over time.

---

## What It Is (the Packaged Brand)

A ready-to-run hackathon format with clear rules, short rounds, and visible results.

- **One shared rhythm:** every team follows **C-I-V-I-K-S** — **Context → Intention (+ Insight) → Vision → Integration → Knowledge → Sustainability (+ Ship)**.
- **Parallel lanes:** seven teams work at once, trading “just-in-time” inputs so no one waits.
- **Clean handoffs:** maps guide partners, partners shape budgets, budgets guide access, access drives communications, all of it feeds measurement and documentation.
- **Ship, not admire:** each lane ends with an owner, a cadence, a budget, and a small launch.

---

## How It Works (Simple, Consistent Flow)

### The CIVIKS Loop for Every Team

1. **Context** – establish what’s true now.
2. **Intention (+ Insight)** – capture motivations, constraints, and must-haves from all stakeholders.
3. **Vision** – define the ideal for this lane.
4. **Integration** – braid your lane with the others.
5. **Knowledge** – write only what another team needs to run it tomorrow.
6. **Sustainability (+ Ship)** – confirm owners, cadence, budget, and launch a first step.

### The Day, at a Glance

- **Open:** problem confirmed, teams formed, room set in zones for fast regrouping.
- **Rounds:** short, focused conversations; if a thread stalls or needs a voice, groups reform.
- **Cross-links:** quick “pulls” between teams to solve blockers in minutes, not hours.
- **Finish:** pilots live, Playbook v1 published, next-90-days owners set.

---

## The Team Roster (Clear Roles, Zero Overlap)

- **TEAM VEKTOR — Map Needs Assessment**: Pinpoint where and for whom the problem is most acute; define data sources and standards.
- **TEAM SWARM — Resource Inventory & Partnerships**: List real partners, assets, and gaps; draft MOUs and activation order.
- **TEAM VAULT — Funding Mobilization**: Stack immediate and sustained funding; align budget with the integrated plan.
- **TEAM REACH — Logistics, Distribution & Access**: Design how services/resources actually move; pick sites, routes, and SOPs.
- **BEAKON — Communications, Outreach & Engagement**: Build message frames, languages, channels, and a week-zero calendar.
- **TEAM Pulse — Monitoring, Reporting & Improvement**: Define what to measure, how often, and how findings trigger adjustments.
- **TEAM PrintNation — Playbook Packaging & Replication**: Turn today’s work into a clean, modular Playbook v1 others can run tomorrow.

> Each team includes lived-experience leaders, frontline staff, operators, partners, and a decision-maker. People rotate between teams to inject missing facts or unblock decisions.

---

## Why This Works (Unique Capabilities)

- **One loop, many lenses:** same steps across teams keep coherence tight.
- **Parallel progress:** seven lanes move together; handoffs are timed and explicit.
- **Insight before design:** facts and stakeholder realities first; fewer revisions later.
- **Tight feedback:** blockers are handled in-round with the right voices, then work resumes.
- **Momentum by design:** every lane ends with **Sustainability + Ship**—owners, cadence, budget, and a real launch.
- **Compounding memory:** all artifacts—maps, MOUs, budgets, routes, messages, metrics, decisions—form a trustworthy knowledge base. That knowledge base becomes the **foundational dataset for training advisory AI models/agents**, turning today’s playbook into tomorrow’s always-on project advisory system.

---

## What You Leave With (Scoreboard, Not Slogans)

1. **Live pilots running** (maps published, partners activated, first route/site, messages out, basic dashboard on).
2. **Playbook v1** (clean, modular, reproducible).
3. **Owners, cadence, and budget** for the next 90 days.
4. **A durable knowledge base** that strengthens future teams and powers advisory AI.

**CIVIKS Hackathon** — clear rules, short rounds, visible results. Knowledge performed, not promised.

---

## Cross-Team Handoffs (Tight Loop)

- **VEKTOR → SWARM/REACH/VAULT:** priority maps drive partners, routes, and budget.
- **SWARM ↔ VAULT:** partner commitments align with funding asks and match requirements.
- **REACH → BEAKON:** site/route details feed public messages and access scripts.
- **All → Pulse:** define metrics from day one; Pulse returns fixes quickly.
- **All → PrintNation:** package into a runnable playbook for launch and replication.

> All artifacts created in these steps become structured knowledge that powers the long-term advisory system. You leave with a playbook **and** a growing knowledge base that future teams (and AI advisors) can learn from and build on.

---

## The Idea in One Sentence (Plain-Language Logic of the Flow)

We split a big problem into seven workstreams, run each through the same simple six-step loop, and keep people moving between conversations so the right knowledge shows up at the right moment. By the end, we ship a working plan, a clear playbook, and a shared body of knowledge that becomes the seed for future advisory systems.

---

## Why the Flow Is Structured This Way

- **One shared rhythm (C-I-V-I-K-S):** Every team follows the same six steps—**Context → Intention (+ Insight) → Vision → Integration → Knowledge → Sustainability (+ Ship)**. A common rhythm keeps the day coherent and lets teams hand work to each other cleanly.
- **Parallel lanes, tight handoffs:** Each team owns a lane (maps, partners, funding, logistics, comms, measurement, playbook). They work in parallel but exchange “just-in-time” inputs so nobody waits to get started.
- **Short, focused cycles:** Conversations run in short rounds with clear goals. When a thread stalls or needs expertise, people re-group. This keeps energy high and prevents long, meandering meetings.
- **Evidence before opinions:** We start with what’s true on the ground (Context), then capture everyone’s reasons and constraints (Intention + **Insight**), and only then design the future (Vision). That order reduces bias and saves time.
- **Ship, don’t admire:** Every lane ends with **Sustainability + Ship**—a small launch or pilot with owners, dates, and a feedback plan. Momentum beats perfection.

## How the Day Unfolds (Narrative)

### 0) Before We Start

Sponsors agree on the problem statement and invite a mix of residents with lived experience, frontline staff, operators, partners, and decision-makers. Everyone gets a quick brief on the seven teams and the shared loop. The room is set in zones so groups can form, dissolve, and reform quickly.

### 1) Context (What’s True Now)

- **VEKTOR** surfaces where the need is greatest and why (maps, hot spots, barriers).
- **SWARM** names which partners exist, which are reliable, and where the gaps are.
- **VAULT** lays out current funding realities and constraints.
- **REACH** explains how goods and services actually move today (bottlenecks, safety).
- **BEAKON** notes what messages work in the community and where trust is thin.
- **Pulse** clarifies what has been measured before and what matters now.
- **PrintNation** watches for patterns to document later.

People rotate between clusters to inject missing facts. We don’t leave Context until the essentials are covered.

### 2) Intention (+ Insight) (Why This Matters, to Whom)

Each team holds a short circle to collect **Insight** from all sides—residents, staff, sponsors, partners. We record motivations, constraints, “must-haves,” and red lines. This step prevents elegant plans that nobody can or will run.

### 3) Vision (What “Good” Looks Like Here)

With facts and motivations in hand, teams sketch an ideal:

- VEKTOR defines a “place-true” map standard.
- SWARM drafts a network of care with clear roles.
- VAULT draws the ideal funding stack and timing.
- REACH designs an access model people can actually use.
- BEAKON crafts a plain-language narrative and multilingual plan.
- Pulse chooses a few meaningful metrics (leading + lagging).
- PrintNation outlines the modules of the future playbook.

Short rounds keep it lively; people move to where their input will change the outcome.

### 4) Integration (Turn It into a Plan)

Now we braid the pieces:

- VEKTOR’s priority areas guide **SWARM**’s first partner activations, **REACH** routes, and **VAULT** budgets.
- **REACH** tells **BEAKON** when and where to communicate.
- **Pulse** turns every plan into trackable signals.
- **PrintNation** assembles checklists, scripts, and templates as they emerge.

If a plan hits a blocker (e.g., a site has no power or a rule forbids a route), the right people are pulled in for a fast fix, then everyone returns to building.

### 5) Knowledge (Make It Reusable)

Every team writes the minimum needed for another crew to run it tomorrow: maps + data dictionary (VEKTOR), partner one-pagers and MOUs (SWARM), budget and submission kit (VAULT), site and route SOPs (REACH), message bank and calendar (BEAKON), dashboard spec and review cadence (Pulse), and a clean, modular **Playbook** (PrintNation). This isn’t paperwork—it’s how we make success repeatable.

### 6) Sustainability (+ Ship) (Keep It Alive, Launch Now)

Each team confirms owners, cadences, and budgets to keep the work going. Then we **Ship** something small but real:

- publish v1 priority maps,
- activate first partners,
- file a first funding submission,
- run a pilot route or pop-up site,
- send a week-zero announcement,
- turn on a simple dashboard,
- release Playbook v1 with a 90-minute handoff.

We leave with a live pilot, not just slides.

---

## Why This Produces “Elegant Collective Intelligence”

- **Shared loop, diverse lenses:** Different teams, same steps. That combination creates coherence without sameness.
- **People move; knowledge flows:** Short rounds and intentional re-grouping ensure the right voices meet the right questions.
- **Insight and Ship as guardrails:** Insight guarantees every plan hears all perspectives. Ship guarantees every plan touches reality.
- **Tight handoffs, no waiting:** Maps drive partners, partners drive budgets, budgets drive routes, routes drive messages, all of it drives measurement and the final playbook.
- **A memory that compounds:** Everything produced—maps, scripts, SOPs, decisions, and outcomes—becomes a clean body of knowledge the community can reuse. That same body of knowledge later trains advisory agents, so future teams get smarter answers faster.

---

## What You Walk Away With

1. A working plan already in motion (first pilots live).
2. A practical, printable Playbook others can run.
3. A trustworthy, growing knowledge base that seeds future advisory systems.

Simple rhythm. Clear roles. Short cycles. Honest handoffs. We make the invisible visible, turn plans into action, and leave a durable memory the whole community can build on.
