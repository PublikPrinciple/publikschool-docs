# Launch Pitch at a Glance

**CIVIKS Hackathon** is a ready-to-run, high-performance event that turns a complex community challenge into coordinated action.
Seven parallel teams cycle through the same six-step loop—**Context → Intention (+ Insight) → Vision → Integration → Knowledge → Sustainability (+ Ship)**—sharing
inputs at precisely timed checkpoints so the day ends with a live pilot, a clear playbook, and a shared knowledge base that compounds.

## What Makes the Format Distinct

- **One shared rhythm:** Every team follows the CIVIKS loop, creating clean handoffs and predictable progress.
- **Parallel lanes:** Seven teams move simultaneously, exchanging "just-in-time" insight so no group waits for another to finish.
- **Clean handoffs:** Outputs cascade logically—maps drive partnerships, partnerships shape budgets, budgets anchor access plans, access guides communications, and everything feeds measurement and documentation.
- **Ship, not admire:** Each team closes the loop with Sustainability + Ship, launching a concrete pilot and securing the owners, cadence, and budget for the next 90 days.

## The Promise in One Sentence

> Turn a big community problem into a high-performance event: seven focused teams run the same six-step loop in short rounds, swap insights at the right moments, and finish the day with a live pilot, a clear playbook, and a shared knowledge base that compounds over time.

## Why It Works

- **Evidence before opinions:** Context and Intention (+ Insight) foreground lived experience, frontline realities, and sponsor constraints before Visioning begins.
- **Tight feedback cycles:** Short, time-boxed rounds prevent drift, and intentional regrouping injects the right expertise exactly when it is needed.
- **Momentum by design:** Insight and Ship provide twin guardrails—plans incorporate every voice and always culminate in a tangible launch.
- **Compounding intelligence:** All artifacts—maps, MOUs, budgets, routes, scripts, dashboards, and decisions—become a growing knowledge base for future teams and advisory AI systems.

## How the Day Runs

1. **Open:** Confirm the shared problem statement, form teams, and orient participants to the CIVIKS loop and room layout.
2. **Context:** Establish current-state truths across all lanes—need maps, partner realities, funding constraints, logistics bottlenecks, messaging history, measurement gaps, and existing documentation.
3. **Intention (+ Insight):** Capture motivations, constraints, and must-haves from residents, frontline staff, partners, sponsors, and decision-makers.
4. **Vision:** Define what success looks like in each lane with the freshly gathered evidence and insight.
5. **Integration:** Braid the seven workstreams so maps inform partnerships, partnerships enable funding, funding unlocks logistics, and so on.
6. **Knowledge:** Document the minimum viable guidance for another team to run the plan tomorrow—checklists, scripts, templates, and dashboards.
7. **Sustainability (+ Ship):** Lock in owners, cadences, and budgets, then launch a first pilot or deliverable before adjournment.

## Team Roster and Outcomes

| Team | Focus | Signature Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **TEAM VEKTOR — Map Needs Assessment** | Reveal priority geographies, barriers, and data sources. | Map stack, data dictionary, update cadence, published priority maps. |
| **TEAM SWARM — Resource Inventory & Partnerships** | Activate partners, assets, and collaboration agreements. | Partner playcards, onboarding flow, first 10 partners activated with weekly stand-ups. |
| **TEAM VAULT — Funding Mobilization** | Secure immediate and sustained funding aligned to the integrated plan. | Budget templates, submission pipeline, compliance calendar, filed first funding submissions, revenue milestones. |
| **TEAM REACH — Logistics, Distribution & Access** | Design how services move with safety and dignity. | Route plans, site SOPs, incident flow, pilot distribution with feedback loop. |
| **BEAKON — Communications, Outreach & Engagement** | Craft multilingual narratives and outreach cadence. | Message matrix, content calendar, scripts, launched week-zero campaign with feedback channel. |
| **TEAM Pulse — Monitoring, Reporting & Improvement** | Define metrics and responsive governance. | Metric dictionary, dashboard spec, review rhythm, live dashboard with weekly review cadence. |
| **TEAM PrintNation — Playbook Packaging & Replication** | Assemble a reproducible playbook. | Playbook v1, handoff training agenda, versioning plan, 90-minute launch briefing scheduled. |

## Cross-Team Logic

- **VEKTOR → SWARM/REACH/VAULT:** Priority maps and equity guardrails guide partner activation, logistics, and funding focus.
- **SWARM ↔ VAULT:** Partner commitments and funding asks stay synchronized for credibility and speed.
- **REACH → BEAKON:** Operational realities inform messaging, language access, and rumor response.
- **All → Pulse:** Measurement embeds from day one, returning actionable feedback into the loop.
- **All → PrintNation:** Every artifact feeds the playbook and the knowledge base that powers future advisory systems.

## Executive Takeaways

1. **Live pilots and visible wins** emerge before the event ends—momentum replaces slideware.
2. **Playbook v1** distills the work into modular guidance others can reuse immediately.
3. **Owners, cadence, and budgets** are locked for the next 90 days, ensuring continuity.
4. **A durable knowledge base** accrues, seeding future teams and AI advisors with trustworthy context.

**CIVIKS Hackathon** delivers clear rules, short rounds, and visible results—knowledge performed, not promised.
