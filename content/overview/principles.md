title: Guiding Principles
description: Core principles for designing and delivering CIVIK Hackathons.
---

The following principles ensure every CIVIK Hackathon advances Publik School’s mission while empowering participants and communities. Treat them as shared commitments when planning, facilitating, or evaluating an event.

## Collaboration over competition

We prioritize cross-team learning and shared ownership of outcomes rather than winner-take-all contests.

- Facilitate open project marketplaces where teams can join forces around shared intentions.
- Encourage reuse of existing Knowledge Artifacts for Organizing (KAOs) and contribute improvements back to the commons.
- Reward teams that help others deliver impact, not just those that ship the flashiest demo.

## Inclusivity and belonging

Every participant should feel welcome, safe, and equipped to contribute.

- Offer multilingual support, stipends, and accessibility accommodations outlined in the [Equity & Access](../equity_access/language_access) section.
- Co-create community agreements during the opening session and revisit them daily.
- Design facilitation moments that intentionally elevate voices from historically marginalized communities.

## Transparency and accountability

Trust is built through clarity. Share how decisions are made, what data is collected, and how outputs will be used.

- Publish agendas, scoring rubrics, and attribution plans ahead of time.
- Maintain a public decision log, capturing trade-offs and rationale for key choices.
- Document consent artifacts using the [Attribution SOP](../consent_attribution/attribution_capture_sop).

## Sustainability and stewardship

Events are catalysts, not endpoints. Plan for the long-term health of people, partners, and artifacts.

- Design follow-up structures such as the [Two-Week Implementation Lab](../formats/two_week_impl_lab) to sustain momentum.
- Ensure KAOs include clear maintenance plans, licensing terms, and custodians.
- Track and report on impact metrics outlined in [Measurement & KPIs](../measurement/metrics_kpis).

## Joyful experimentation

Hackathons should spark creativity and joy while solving real problems.

- Provide prompts that connect civic challenges to community passions.
- Celebrate learning moments, even when prototypes fail.
- Create spaces—digital and physical—that invite play, reflection, and shared celebration.

Revisit these principles in pre-briefs, daily check-ins, and post-event retrospectives. They anchor decision-making when trade-offs arise and help Publik School maintain a consistent experience across every CIVIK Hackathon.
